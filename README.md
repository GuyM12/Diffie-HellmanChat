The project is Diffie-Hellman Chat between bob and alice. Bob and alice are a one computer bot and you will chat with yourself, however the chat represent the special encrytption and key transfer.

**Key.Java** - Represent a key object (The key is being used to encrypt and decrypt a messege).

**TransferKey.java** - Making a "connection", a key transform between towo clients (or server, basically it's the same).

**client.java** - Represent a client object (A person with keys and names).

**Main.java** - An example for a conversation, with exchange of keys in the start and encrypting, decreypting from both clients.

To run the project all you need to do is run the Main method and if you want you can change the value as you'd like. In addition right now I am using the keys to encrypt with cesar encryption, I will be more than happy to hear more encryption so i could use..
